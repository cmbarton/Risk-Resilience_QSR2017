These data files and analysis scripts were used in the meta-analysis of hunter-gatherer ecology in the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene published in Quaternary Science Reviews. The full reference is:

See the above paper and supplemental information for the many sources of the archaeological data compiled here. 

Ice core data are derived from data sets accompanying the following 2 papers:

Rasmussen, S.O., Bigler, M., Blockley, S.P., Blunier, T., Buchardt, S.L., Clausen, H.B., Cvijanovic, I., Dahl-Jensen, D., Johnsen, S.J., Fischer, H., Gkinis, V., Guillevic, M., Hoek, W.Z., Lowe, J.J., Pedro, J.B., Popp, T., Seierstad, I.K., Steffensen, J.P., Svensson, A.M., Vallelonga, P., Vinther, B.M., Walker, M.J.C., Wheatley, J.J., Winstrup, M., 2014. A stratigraphic framework for abrupt climatic changes during the Last Glacial period based on three synchronized Greenland ice-core records: refining and extending the INTIMATE event stratigraphy. Quaternary Science Reviews 106, 14-28.

Seierstad, I.K., Abbott, P.M., Bigler, M., Blunier, T., Bourne, A.J., Brook, E., Buchardt, S.L., Buizert, C., Clausen, H.B., Cook, E., Dahl-Jensen, D., Davies, S.M., Guillevic, M., Johnsen, S.J., Pedersen, D.S., Popp, T.J., Rasmussen, S.O., Severinghaus, J.P., Svensson, A., Vinther, B.M., 2014. Consistently dated records from the Greenland GRIP, GISP2 and NGRIP ice cores for the past 104 ka reveal regional millennial-scale Î´18O gradients with possible Heinrich event imprint. Quaternary Science Reviews 106, 29-46.

Data are provided in CSV and RData (*.rda) formats. R Markdown scripts will reproduce all analyses except for GIS maps and calculations of contemporaneous paleocoastlines. 

To reproduce analyses reported in the Barton et al QSR paper, expand R_scripts.zip and rdata_files.zip into the same folder. Open the *.rmd scripts in RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com), and run the script. After loading the data files (initial chunk in the *.rmd script), any chunk in the script should be runable. The csv files can also be imported into R and used by the script.
